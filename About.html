	<h1>The History Of Coffee</h1>

	<p>England first became acquainted with coffee in 1637 when a Turk introduced the drink to Oxford. It quickly became popular among students and teachers who established the "Oxford Coffee Club".<br/><br/>The first coffeehouse in Oxford opened in 1650 and was called the "Angel".<br/><br/>In 1652, a Greek named Pasqua Ros√©e opened the first coffeehouse in London. Using his extensive knowledge of how to prepare and brew Turkish Coffee, he introduced his friends and clients to its peerless taste.</p>
