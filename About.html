    <h1>Ethical Drinking...</h1>

    <p>Ethics are extremely important to us - and it's threrefore crucial to be aware of the ethics of drinking coffee, as well as of the coffee shops themselves. How can you be sure that you’re buying a coffee that doesn’t exploit the people who grew it? The good news is that it’s actually easy to support the farmer who has laboured for many hours to grow and process your coffee.<br/><br/><strong>The key lies in the quality.</strong> Farmers growing high quality coffee will almost always be operating ethically. Look at the company roasting the coffee. What are their ethics, are they supporting the push towards higher quality products, assisting and educating farmers? Specialty coffee roasters are all about paying a generous price for high quality coffee, grown in the best conditions, by people who are treated fairly.<br/><br/>The coffee shops featured on our map all maintian the highest ethical standards, so if you take a recommendation from our website, you can ensure you're drinking both <strong>great</strong> and <strong>fairtrade</strong> coffee!</p>

    <h1>How Coffee Is Made</h1>

    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the <em>Coffea plant</em>. You can see how coffee turns from a seed to the liquid in your cup in the infograph below:</p>
