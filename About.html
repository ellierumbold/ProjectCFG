  <h1>The History Of Coffee</h1>

  <p>England first became acquainted with coffee in 1637 when a Turk introduced the drink to Oxford. It quickly became popular among students and teachers who established the "<em>Oxford Coffee Club</em>".<br/><br/>The first coffeehouse in Oxford opened in 1650 and was called the "<em>Angel</em>".<br/><br/>In 1652, a Greek named Pasqua Rosée opened the first coffeehouse in London. Using his extensive knowledge of how to prepare and brew Turkish Coffee, he introduced his friends and clients to its interesting and exotic taste.</p>

    <h1>Ethical Drinking...</h1>

    <p>Ethics are extremely important to us - and it's threrefore crucial to be aware of the ethics of drinking coffee, as well as of the coffee shops themselves. How can you be sure that you’re buying a coffee that doesn’t exploit the people who grew it? The good news is that it’s actually easy to support the farmer who has laboured for many hours to grow and process your coffee.<br/><br/><strong>The key lies in the quality.</strong> Farmers growing high quality coffee will almost always be operating ethically. Look at the company roasting the coffee. What are their ethics, are they supporting the push towards higher quality products, assisting and educating farmers? Specialty coffee roasters are all about paying a generous price for high quality coffee, grown in the best conditions, by people who are treated fairly.<br/><br/>The coffee shops featured on our map all maintian the highest ethical standards, so if you take a recommendation from our website, you can ensure you're drinking both <strong>great</strong> and <strong>fairtrade</strong> coffee!</p>
